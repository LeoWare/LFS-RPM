This build tracks linux from scratch version 7.5

This build system requires the following:
	Fetch build system from https://www.github.com/baho-utot/LFS-RPM
	Directory for LFS under build,	mounted at /mnt/lfs
	This can be a partition mounted there but you will be responsible
	for that as this build system uses just a directory at ${LFS}
	
	This system was designed and debugged on an AMD64 {x86_64} system and
	I have not tested it on a i686 system as I no longer have or use such
	systems.  I have tried to keep it compatable with i686 but I may have
	missed some thing, so you may need to address some issues with 
	building/using this system.  Also there is no current configuration
	file for i686 and you will need to provide that
	
	You will need some understanding of shell scripting as you will
	need to alter some of the parameters in these scripts.

Notes:
	This build system uses su.
	If you don't want to enter the root password on every step then
	you can temporary modify /etc/passwd and remove the x in the
	root user entry.
	sed -i 's/root:x/root:/' /etc/passwd
	
	The build system installs to /mnt/lfs/usr/src/Octothorpe

WARNING:
	This build system can trash your host.  

The script to build LFS has changed

Edit config.inc to suit your system

Build Procedure goes as follows:
	
command to run			These are just comments don't enter these
------------------------------	----------------------------------------- 
su -c ./mk-setup-lfs		Setup and install build system
su -c ./mk-tools		Build toolchain
su -c ./mk-lfs			Build system

Build at this point is complete.
The following are some support scripts if you require them.

su -c ./mk-clean-lfs		Restores host system to pre build state
				Removes the work you have just built
				Use only when you have saved the binary
				and source rpms and anything you may want
				to save.
				If you are going to build BLFS-RPM you
				will need to retain the LFS-RPM work as
				it is required for that build
				
su -c./mk-install-lfs		Support script that can install the previous
				build rpms onto a partition mounted at /mnt
				You did save the binary and source rpms
				didn't you?
				Read the script before using it
				
				
install grub 			if needed
create grub/grub.cfg in /boot	add the LFS menu entry
Installing grub:

Notes:
	This is one way to install grub,
	You will need to edit the set root=(hdx,x) and
	root=/dev/sdxx lines to suit.
	If you don't have a boot partition you will need to
	change: linux /vmlinuz-<VERSION> root=/dev/sdxx ro
	to:	linux /boot/vmlinux-<VERSION> root=/dev/sdxx> ro

	grub-install --force --boot-directory=/mnt/lfs/boot /dev/sda

	cat > /boot/grub/grub.cfg << "EOF"
	# Begin /boot/grub/grub.cfg
	set default=0
	set timeout=5

	menuentry "GNU/Linux Linux from scratch" {
		insmod ext2
		set root=(hdx,x)
		linux /vmlinuz-<VERSION> root=</dev/sdxx ro
	 }
	# 	Uncomment this if you have Win what-ever installed
	#	change set root=(hdx,x) to where you have win installed
	#	set root=(hd0,1) usually
 	#menuentry "Windows" {
	#	insmod ntfs
	#	set root=(hdx,x)
	#	chainloader +1
	# }
	# End /boot/grub/grub.cfg
	 EOF

This completes the build.
